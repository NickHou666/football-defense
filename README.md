# football-defense
This project develops a theoretical framework for optimizing defensive assignments in football (soccer) using a dynamic cost-based matching model. I formulate the defender-attacker allocation problem as a time-evolving bipartite matching under threat-weighted cost functions, and incorporate switching penalties to model tactical consistency.
